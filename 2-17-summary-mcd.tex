% Read and Summarize Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents - Teh, Daume and Roy, NIPS, 2008.

Teh, Daume and Roy (2008) introduce a new model for Bayesian agglomerative clustering based on a prior over trees derived from population genetics. The prior, known as Kingman's coalescent, describes genealogies in an evolutionary process. $n$ haploid (single-parent) individuals observed at time $t=0$ are assumed to have a common ancestor at some point {before -infty}. 

% How does this hierarchical clustering model compare to Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering? How does the hierarchical component of this model differ from the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process?
