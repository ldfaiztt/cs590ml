% Read and Summarize Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents - Teh, Daume and Roy, NIPS, 2008.

Teh, Daume and Roy (2008) introduce a new model for Bayesian agglomerative clustering based on a prior over trees derived from population genetics. 
The prior, known as Kingman's coalescent, describes genealogies in an evolutionary process. 
$n$ haploid (single-parent) individuals observed at time $t=0$ are assumed to have a common ancestor at $t=-\infty$. 
The genealogies of the $n$ individuals from a directed forest, and $\pi(t)$ identifies the $m$ ancestors of $[n]$ at time $t$. 
A coalescent event refers to the point $t<0$ when two individuals' genealogies converge at their common ancestor. 
The time between adjacent events $\delta_i$ is distributed exponentially with $\lamda={n-i+1 \choose 2}. 
Taking the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ we have a marginally independent, infinitely exchangeable distribution over genealogies known as the $n$-coalescent. 

% How does this hierarchical clustering model compare to Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering? How does the hierarchical component of this model differ from the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process?
